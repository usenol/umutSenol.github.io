                    Breakfast at our hotel is not just the first meal of the day; it's a culinary experience designed to
                    cater to diverse tastes and preferences, ensuring a delightful start for all our guests. We believe
                    that a great day begins with a great breakfast, and we go above and beyond to provide an extensive
                    array of options that feature both local and international flavors.
                    For a personalized touch, our live cooking stations are a popular highlight. Here, guests can have
                    their eggs, omelets, or crepes made to order with their choice of fillings and toppings. Whether you
                    prefer a fluffy omelet with fresh vegetables and cheese or a sweet crepe drizzled with chocolate and
                    fruits, our chefs are ready to prepare it just the way you like.
                    Our breakfast buffet is expansive and inclusive, offering everything from hot dishes to cold cuts.
                    Guests can enjoy a variety of breads, pastries, and cereals, along with fresh fruits, yogurt, and a
                    selection of cheeses and meats. Hot options typically include traditional breakfast items like
                    bacon, sausages, eggs in various styles, pancakes, and waffles, all freshly prepared.
