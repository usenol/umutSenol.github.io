Our beach volleyball court is ideally situated on a stretch of soft, fine sand, bordered by the gentle waves of the sea. This picturesque backdrop not only enhances the game experience but also invites players to dive, jump, and spike the ball with a scenic view. The court is equipped with a high-quality, regulation-size volleyball net and the boundary lines are clearly marked for easy visibility. We provide all necessary equipment, including lightweight, professional-grade volleyballs that are perfect for beach play. Nearby, you'll find seating areas for spectators who prefer to watch and cheer rather than participate. Playing beach volleyball at our hotel is not just about physical exercise; it's a highly social activity. It encourages teamwork and communication, making it an excellent opportunity for bonding with old friends or making new ones. The energetic nature of the game, combined with the refreshing ocean breeze, ensures a delightful experience that energizes the body and uplifts the spirit."
